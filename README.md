This is a simple, open source passwordmanager.

Functionality: 
1. Save a password. <br />
	1.1 Choose whether you want to encrypt your password or not. Encrypting your password can be adventageous if you want to enter a simple password, for example a word, but want 	a save password for your account. <br />
	1.2 Enter the use for your password. This is needed for loading the password afterwards. <br />
	1.3 Choose a masterpassword. This is your masterpassword, used for saving and loading your passwordfile. You need to remember this, though if you forget it, you can find it 	in {use}masterpassword.txt (Will change).
<br />
	1.4. You can add multiple passwords in 1 passworddirectory with the same masterpassword
    <br />
	1.4 Enter the password you want to save. <br />
	1.5 If you chose to encrypt your password, enter a key to encrypt your password. The key needs to consist of min 1 letter and max 26 letters. After entering, the password and 	key will get saved. <br />

3. Load a password. <br />
	2.1  Enter your use as well as masterpassword to encrcypt your password. (Forgot your Masterpassword? Get help in 1.3) <br />

4. Generate a password. <br />
	3.1 Enter the use for your password. <br />
	3.2 Choose a masterpassword. Again, this will be used to safely save and load your password. <br />
	3.3 Enter the length of your password. There is no max length. <br />

Work in Progress:
1. Simple UI.
2. Optimisation
3. /help command
